This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 

I have analysed this dataset in 4 Parts:

 
1.) Impact of Gender and Age with Showing up at the appointment
 
2.) Impact of government incentives and assistance with showing       up at the appointment.
 
3.) Schedule day, Appointment day relation with showing up at the     appointment.
 
4.) Impact of diseases or health problems with showing up at the     appointment.
